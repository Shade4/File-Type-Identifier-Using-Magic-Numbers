# File-Type-Identifier-Using-Magic-Numbers
A cross-platform file analysis and security tool that identifies the true file type by inspecting file headers (magic numbers), rather than trusting file extensions.  
This project helps detect disguised or malicious files commonly used in malware delivery, phishing attacks, and social engineering.
